A serverless, cloud-native image processing application deployed on AWS. This application allows users to upload, process, share, and manage their photos with features like recycling bin, auth protection, and multi-region resilience.

## üîç Overview

This application is built using AWS Serverless technology stack, utilizing services such as Lambda, API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB, Cognito, SQS, and CloudWatch. It's designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and easy to deploy across multiple environments.

The app enables users to upload, process, and manage their photos in a secure and reliable way, with features like authentication, image processing, sharing capabilities, recycling bin, and comprehensive health monitoring.

## ‚ú® Features

- **User Authentication** - Secure login/signup via Cognito with email verification
- **Image Upload & Processing** - Upload and automatic processing of images
- **Image Sharing** - Share images with other users
- **Recycle Bin** - Soft delete with recovery options
- **Cross-Region Replication** - Data storage across multiple AWS regions for disaster recovery
- **Health Monitoring** - Comprehensive health checks and alerting
- **Serverless Architecture** - Fully serverless deployment for maximum scalability
- **HTTPS Support** - Secure communication with custom domain and SSL certificate
- **Email Notifications** - Welcome emails and login alerts

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture pattern with the following main components:

1. **Client-facing API** - API Gateway with custom domain
2. **Authentication Layer** - Cognito User Pool with custom triggers
3. **Image Processing Pipeline** - Lambda functions with SQS queues
4. **Storage Layer** - S3 buckets with lifecycle policies and cross-region replication
5. **Database Layer** - DynamoDB Global Tables
6. **Monitoring & Alerting** - CloudWatch, Route53 Health Checks, and SNS

    - User pool backups

6. **Health Check Service**
    - Monitors the health of all system components
    - Exposes health check endpoints

### Infrastructure Components

- **S3 Buckets**:
    - Staging bucket for initial uploads
    - Processed bucket with versioning and replication
    - Replica bucket in a different region for disaster recovery

- **DynamoDB Tables**:
    - Photo table for image metadata (Global Table)
    - Backup table for Cognito user data (Global Table)

- **API Gateway**:
    - Regional endpoint with custom domain
    - HTTPS support with ACM certificate
    - CORS configuration

- **Cognito**:
    - User Pool with email verification
    - Custom triggers for welcome emails and signin alerts

- **SQS Queues**:
    - Main processing queue
    - Dead letter queue with automatic redrive policy

- **Monitoring**:
    - Route53 health checks
    - CloudWatch alarms
    - SNS topics for alerts

## üîß Infrastructure as Code

The application is defined using AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) and CloudFormation. The main template file (`template.yaml`) defines all resources, permissions, and event sources.

## üöÄ Deployment

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI installed and configured
- AWS SAM CLI installed
- Java 21 JDK installed
- Maven installed (for building Java Lambda functions)

### Deployment Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moses-ayandau/image-sharing-microservice.git
   cd photo-app
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

3. Deploy using SAM:
   ```bash
   sam deploy --guided
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to set parameters:
    - Stack Name: `photo-app-stack`
    - AWS Region: `us-east-1`
    - Environment: `dev`, `test`, or `prod`
    - Other parameters as needed

### Multi-Environment Deployment

The application supports multiple environments (dev, test, prod) through parameters:

```bash
# For development
sam deploy --parameter-overrides Environment=dev

# For testing
sam deploy --parameter-overrides Environment=test

# For production
sam deploy --parameter-overrides Environment=prod
```

## üîê Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration. These are defined in the CloudFormation template and passed to Lambda functions:

| Variable | Description | Default Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `ENVIRONMENT` | Deployment environment | `test` |
| `STAGING_BUCKET` | Name of the bucket for initial uploads | `image-staging-bucket-{env}-{account}` |
| `PROCESSED_BUCKET` | Name of the bucket for processed images | `image-processed-bucket-{env}-{account}` |
| `IMAGE_TABLE` | DynamoDB table for image metadata | `photo` |
| `QUEUE_URL` | URL of the SQS processing queue | - |
| `EMAIL_SOURCE` | Source email for notifications | `noreply@mscv2group2.link` |
| `APP_URL` | Application frontend URL | `https://mscv2group2.link` |

## üì° API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|--------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| POST | `/upload` | Upload a new image | Yes |
| GET | `/users/{userId}/images/active` | Get active images for a user | Yes |
